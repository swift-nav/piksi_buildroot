## NORMAL TARGETS ##

firmware          - Download the firmware artifacts for the RTOS and FPGA 
                    (required to build a complete firmware image).
config
host-config       - Configure buildroot to build for Piksi Multi, or for
                    the host (testing) target.
image
host-image        - Compile buildroot, and assemble and Piksi Multi update
                    package (.bin image set) or build a host image for 
                    running unit tests.
clean           
host-clean        - Clean all downloads, build materials and output
                    artifacts.
pkg-%
host-pkg-%        - Run a target inside of buildroot (for the target
                    system or for the host system), for example:
                        make pkg-ntrip_daemon-rebuild
                    Or:
                        make pkg-ntrip_daemon-dirclean
## UTILITY TARGETS ##

flush-rootfs      - Force buildroot the restage all files in the target
                    filesystem, useful to ensure the assembled filesystem
                    image is consistent.
rebuild-chagned   - Run the buildroot target `<package>-rebuild` for all
                    external projects that have changed in the current
                    source tree.

## DOCKER TARGETS ##

docker-setup      - Configure Docker for first run.  Use export
                    DOCKER_SUFFIX to your environement in order to build
                    multiple buildroot repositories that use docker.

The following targets are analogs of the above, but run within docker:

  docker-config
  docker-make-firmware
  docker-make-image
  docker-make-host-image
  docker-make-clean
  docker-make-host-clean

  docker-rebuild-changed
  docker-make-flush-rootfs
  docker-pkg-%

Docker utility targets:

docker-cp         - Copies files out of the docker container, uses the
                    following syntax:
                      make docker-cp SRC=<docker-path> DST=<local-path>
docker-run        - Launches a shell inside the docker container for
                    running commands and inspecting the contents of
                    the container.
docker-make-clean-volume
                  - Wipes the docker volume (`<root>/buildroot` inside
                    of the docker container) that's  used to build the
                    image.
docker-make-clean-all
                  - Wipes the docker volume and cleans all build
                    artifacts.
