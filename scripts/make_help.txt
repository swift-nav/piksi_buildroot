## NORMAL TARGETS ##

firmware          - Download the firmware artifacts for the RTOS and FPGA 
                    (required to build a complete firmware image).
config
host-config       - Configure buildroot to build for Piksi Multi, or for
                    the host (testing) target.
image
host-image        - Compile buildroot, and assemble and Piksi Multi update
                    package (.bin image set) or build a host image for 
                    running unit tests.
clean           
host-clean        - Clean all downloads, build materials and output
                    artifacts.
pkg-%
host-pkg-%        - Run a target inside of buildroot (for the target
                    system or for the host system), for example:
                        make pkg-ntrip_daemon-rebuild
                    Or:
                        make pkg-ntrip_daemon-dirclean
## UTILITY TARGETS ##

flush-rootfs      - Force buildroot the restage all files in the target
                    filesystem, useful to ensure the assembled filesystem
                    image is consistent.
rebuild-chagned   - Run the buildroot target `<package>-rebuild` for all
                    external projects that have changed in the current
                    source tree.

## DOCKER TARGETS ##

docker-setup      - Configure Docker for first run.  Use export
                    DOCKER_SUFFIX to your environement in order to build
                    multiple buildroot repositories that use docker.

The following targets are analogs of the above, but run within docker:

  docker-config
  docker-make-firmware
  docker-make-image
  docker-make-host-image
  docker-make-clean
  docker-make-host-clean

  docker-rebuild-changed
  docker-make-flush-rootfs
  docker-pkg-%

Docker utility targets:

docker-cp         - Copies files out of the docker container, uses the
                    following syntax:

                      make docker-cp SRC=<docker-path> DST=<local-path>

docker-shell
docker-run        - Launches a shell inside the docker container for
                    running commands and inspecting the contents of
                    the container.

docker-make-clean-volume
                  - Wipes the docker volume (`<root>/buildroot` inside
                    of the docker container) that's  used to build the
                    image.
docker-make-clean-all
                  - Wipes the docker volume and cleans all build
                    artifacts.

The `docker-run` target can be used to run arbitrary commands inside the
container as follows:

  make docker-run ARGS="scp README.md root@192.168.0.222:"

## DOCKER SYNC TARGETS ##

The `docker-sync-*` targets are used to configure the repostiory for use with
docker-sync, which moves all of the source files and build materials into a
container volume.  Normally only the build materials are captured in a
container.

The `docker-sync` configuration can be used to build with a remote DOCKER_HOST
and to avoid data sync issues/delays with non-native docker hosts (like OS X).

The follow targets are used to setup this environment:

docker-sync-setup - Sets up the `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-sync.yml`
                    files for the docker-sync daemon.

docker-sync-start - Starts the docker-sync daemon.

docker-sync-logs  - The logs from the docker-sync daemon.

docker-sync-stop  - Stop the docker-sync daemon

docker-sync-clean - Cleans and wipes the docker-sync config

## MISC. TARGETS ##

docker-aws-google-auth - used to acquire AWS credentials, requires that
                         GOOGLE_IDP_ID, GOOGLE_SP_ID, and GOOGLE_USERNAME
                         to be set in the environement.
